<p>Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. They are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, and Eurasia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, claws, and short tails.</p>

  <p>The lion is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.</p>

<p>Monkeys are tailed primates, with the exception of lemurs, tarsiers, and lorises. They are clever, social animals, and are known for running and leaping through trees with ease. Monkeys are typically smaller than apes and usually have tails, which apes lack. They are arboreal, using all four limbs to leap from tree to tree</p>

<p>Alligators, like other crocodilians, are large animals with powerful tails that are used both in defense and in swimming (see also crocodile). Their eyes, ears, and nostrils are placed on top of their long head and project slightly above the water when the reptiles float at the surface, as they often do.</p>
